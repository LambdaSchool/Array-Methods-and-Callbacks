REMEMBER: Add the "LIVE server" extension to Visual Studio Code and use it for this project:

If it's not used, you won't have access to the fifa.js data since the import statement 
above needs an environment with a server to work properly.

/* Task 1: Access the Data

Practice accessing the fifa data by console.log-ing the following:
    1. Home Team name for 2014 World Cup Final
    2. Away Team name for 2014 World Cup Final
    3. Home Team goals for 2014 World Cup Final
    4. Away Team goals for 2014 World Cup Final
    5. Winner of 2014 World Cup Final 

HINT: There is a lot of data to go through so think of ways you can narrow it down

/* Task 2: Get Finals

Use the `getFinals` function below to do the following:
    1. Receive fifaData in a parameter 
    2. Return an array of objects containing all of the finals games data
    
NOTE: The finals games have the stage of "Final" - ignore quarter-final, semi-final etc.

/* Task 3: Get Years

Use the higher-order function `getYears` below to do the following:
    1. Receive fifaData in a parameter
    2. Receive in a parameter the callback function `getFinals()` created in Task 2
    3. Return an array called `years` containing the years the finals were played

Use the higher-order function `getWinners` below to do the following:

    2. Receive in a parameter the callback function `getFinals()` created in Task 2
    3. Determine the winner (home or away) of each `finals` game
    4. Return an array called `winners` that contains the names of all the countries that won

Use the higher-order function `getWinnersByYear` below to do the following:
    1. Receive fifaData in a parameter
    2. Receive in a parameter the callback function `getYears()` created in Task 3
    3. Receive in a parameter the callback function `getWinners()` created in Task 4
    4. Using the data returned by the callback functions, return an array containing 
       a set of strings that say: "In {year}, {country} won the world cup!"

/* Task 6: Get Average Goals

Use the function `getAverageGoals` below to do the following:
    1. Receive fifaData in a parameter
    2. Return the the average number of goals (home and away goals combined) scored from ALL the matches
    
HINT: use .reduce and do this in 2 steps
